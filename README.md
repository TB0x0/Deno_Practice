## A repository to contain practice Deno code. 
Any larger stand alone projects I make will be contained in separate repositories.

#### My notes
The best installation method I have found is using Cargo.
- From a Debian based distro if you don't already have cargo:
    
    `apt install cargo`
    `cargo install deno`

The best method for Windows for me is using powershell
    
    `iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex`

Then make sure it installed right by using
    
    `deno --version`
